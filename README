# Phase 2 - Parser
### March 8, 2024
Everything inside of the 'node' and 'exceptions' directories was a part of our work for this phase. Also we filled out
JottParser.java as the culmination of all of our other work.

# Phase 1 - Tokenizer
### February 9, 2024
We only wrote code in the JottTokenizer.java file during this phase, so that is the only file being submitted
alongside this README.
